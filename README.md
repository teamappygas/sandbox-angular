Sandbox for michael 

Create the angular project following the tutorial.
Install VS code (with WSL for windows if you're on windows)  if it's not already done.

Then do you first commit :

- Git add .
- git commit -m "First commit with angular app"
- git remote add appygasrepo git@github.com:teamappygas/sandbox-angular.git (usually people call it **origin**, you can call it origin if you want)
- git push appygasrepo master

If you have any question regarding what your doing you can send me an email and point at a specific commit or leave comments in the code like //@malaville :)
